The first feat lets you become totally immune to non-spell attacks from one direction as a move action. \
Probably mainly of interest to casters, who can be at range (where this ability shines) and who often have a move action spare \
but also usable by mounted characters, who have a move action free after a mounted charge. <br>

The second feat represents a dramatic increase to Touch AC, which is of interest to anyone, and extends your \
directional protection to allies (including potentially your mount). <br>

The third feat lets you negate an attack as an immediate action, which is extremely powerful. <br>

These feats all also gradually reduce the penalties associated with using a weapon alongside a tower shield, which is nice.
